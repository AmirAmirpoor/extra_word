## How To Play

Once you hit START THE GAME button you will see a board which contains a few words and a button below the board which says NEXT.

You are supposed to memorize these words. Once you're certain you memorized all of them by clicking on the next button another board will be displayed and the new board contains all the previous words and also ONE EXTRA WORD.
